Project Setup

Prerequisites
Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.

Create a React Project:

Use the create-react-app tool to initialize a new React project.
Navigate to the project directory.

Create a new JavaScript file for the file upload component in the src directory.
Define a React component that uses the useState hook to manage the state of the selected file.
Implement a file input element to allow users to choose a file from their system.
Add functionality to display the selected file name on the page.
Include a button or icon for downloading the selected file, with an event handler to manage the download action.

Modify the main application component to include the newly created file upload component.
Run the React App:
Use the npm start to start the React development server.
Open the browser to see the app running locally.


Backend (Node.js)
Create a Node.js Project:

Create a new directory for the backend project.
Initialize a new Node.js project using npm.
Install Express: This is used to connect the server in backend and assign the port for the client requests and responses

Create a new JavaScript file for the server.
Set up an Express server to listen on port 3000
Define a route to handle file download requests. This route should read a file from the serverâ€™s storage and send it to the client.
Run the Node.js Server:

Ensure Both Servers Are Running:
The React app should be running on its default port (e.g., 3000).

After running the both servers go to localhost:3000 to see the output 
Here there is a choose file button to select the file and upload to your page again run the backend server using node ports.js
And then click upload after successfully uploaded then click download to download the file to your downloads.
By following these steps, one can set up and understand the file upload and download functionality using React.js and Node.js.
